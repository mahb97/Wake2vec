# 26 of feb, damn it's almost March, the year is basically over.

## Llama 3.2-1B P1 (resuming from step 2300)

Some joke about switching models like switching lanes.

### Loss table (continued from DEVLOG_0222)

| Step | Train | Val | Notes |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| 700 | | | resumed from sentry |
| 800 | 70.8957 | 7.7487 | (Feb 19) |
| 1000 | 65.7121 | 7.8129 | (Feb 19) |
| 1200 | 61.0022 | 7.8385 | (Feb 19, session end) |
| 1400 | 78.6625 | 5.3643 | (Feb 22) train spike, val dropped hard |
| 1600 | 69.8318 | 5.4102 | (Feb 22) val flat, train coming down |
| 1800 | 64.9033 | 5.4270 | (Feb 22) train still dropping, val plateau ~5.4 |
| 2000 | 63.4614 | 5.4470 | val still flat at ~5.4, four checkpoints now |
| 2200 | 60.3241 | 5.4557 | five checkpoints of plateau, session end |
| | | | |

### Notes

- Val has been flat at ~5.4 for three checkpoints (1400-1800). Train loss steadily dropping (78.7 → 64.9). Either the model is memorising training data without generalising, or val is about to break through to a new regime. Might see the end of this p1 today
- 700 steps remaining to reach 3,000
