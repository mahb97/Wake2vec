## Llama 3.2-1B P1 (light at the end of the tunnel and it's not a train, just step 3000)

Resuming from step 2600 so 400 steps to go and at ~17s/step that's under 2 hours, so this P1 finishes today.

Val has been plateaued at ~5.46 since step 1400 (six checkpoints now). Train loss still dropping (78.7 → 61.9). The diverging train/val gap is interesting, but train batches include hard lexicon-heavy examples while val is purely FW text.

### Loss table (continued from DEVLOG_0226)

| Step | Train | Val | Notes |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| 1400 | 78.66 | 5.36 | val breakthrough |
| 1600 | 69.83 | 5.41 | |
| 1800 | 64.90 | 5.43 | |
| 2000 | 63.46 | 5.45 | |
| 2200 | 60.32 | 5.46 | |
| 2600 | 61.92 | 5.46 | |
