## TinyLlama P2 LoRA continued

Back on TinyLlama P2 today. Colab gave 1hr 40min before disconnect (gaslight GPU).

### Loss table (continued from day before yesterday)

| Step | Train | Val | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1200 | 0.5797 | 0.6255 | 0.046 |
| 1400 | 0.6388 | 0.6393 | 0.001 |
| 1600 | 0.5722 | 0.6460 | 0.074 |
| 1800 | 0.6104 | 0.6594 | 0.049 |
| 2000 | 0.4943 | 0.6679 | 0.174 |
| 2200 | 0.4660 | 0.6736 | 0.208 |
| 2400 | 0.5128 | 0.6791 | 0.166 |
| 2600 | 0.4756 | 0.6817 | 0.206 |

Overfitting continuing but val loss is barely moving (0.668 -> 0.674 -> 0.679 over 400 steps) and train loss bouncing around 0.47-0.51. Best checkpoint for generation still looks like step 1400-1600.
